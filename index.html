    <p class="intro">
     <strong>In a world where our lives are primarily or even entirely online, it becomes critical to examine the digital structures that are now facilitating our social lives.</strong>
     The internet has an extensive history both as a technology and as a platform for communication. It creates a space that supports a variety of subcultures and communities. 
      Internet history is largely unexplored and undocumented, especially regarding its social usage. Looking at these communities at a micro level is definitely interesting and worthwhile, 
      but in today’s circumstances it becomes more urgent to look at the phenomenon of online communities at a macro level. The problems of our real and in-person lives appear differently through online mediums, 
      and it’s critical to examine the ways in which the regular borders of our lives are impacted by method and platform. First, I explore the phenomenon of the “virtual self”, or the personas that people adopt online. 
      Then, I cover a brief history of the social applications of the internet, as well as my own experiences with online communities. 
      Finally, I look to the phenomenon of borders, focusing on “real” borders that are recreated, as well as new and uniquely online borders that are presented.

	<p>When considering online borders, it’s important to understand that the internet creates a less clearly defined version of the self. The structure of online spaces and communities creates
 isolated groups in which it’s possible to create a new self that’s almost completely disconnected from your actual, physical person. This creates a unique space for self-exploration, in which one can explore
 an aspect of their identity without having to fully commit to it. You can create almost a site-specific version of yourself that can be adopted (or abandoned) at a moment's notice. Therefore, borders between
 the self and another force become hazy and less clearly defined, because the self becomes less strictly defined.
<br><br>
	In researching for this project, I began to reflect on some of the “personas” I’ve used online over the years. I looked through my 
earliest online accounts, where I used personas as a way to share art and creative work without having to directly deal with their reactions. The 
internet created a wall between me and the viewer, which eventually helped me become confident enough to share my work without that wall. Currently, I 
have a few different usernames that I use for separate purposes- primarily, for interacting with people I know in real life and for interacting with people I don’t. 
I felt incredibly isolated when the pandemic set in and most of my real life shut down, and I turned to online communities and ultimately online friends for support. 
It allowed me to feel social and connected without having to face the anxiety that came with in-person interaction. In her book The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit, 
Sherry Turkle describes this phenomenon quite well, stating that “The computer offers a unique mixture of being alone and yet not feeling alone.” (139). During a global pandemic, 
being alone but not feeling alone was exactly what I needed, and I had the opportunity to explore that through my “virtual self”. I really try to keep these versions of myself separate, but over time my 
real life has started to bleed into my virtual life. People tend to have their own approaches to these borders within the self; some try to keep their online life and their offline life completely separate, 
whereas some don’t mind them mixing a little. I have some online friends who don’t even share their real first names, and some who are perfectly comfortable talking about topics 
like the cities they live in or what they do for work.
<br><br>
Within these online communities, there are some ways in which traditional borders are amplified, and some ways in which other borders are ignored. For example, international borders are often of less importance. 
In my primary group of “internet friends”, there are people from all over the world (although fairly heavily skewed towards North America and Europe). However, national borders may matter less but timezones create a 
very active border. Scheduling events very often prioritizes one area of the world over the others. Active communication is generally scheduled according to American time zones, sometimes forcing people outside of North and 
South America to choose between their sleep schedules and their social lives; it’s a semi-regular occurrence to be having a conversation and suddenly remember that it’s the middle of the night for the other person. Additionally, 
in spaces with people from all over the world, language barriers are increasingly visible. Conversation happens entirely in English, despite people speaking a wide variety of languages. People also often struggle to feel involved or keep up 
with conversations if they’re less fluent or are still learning the language. Things like class borders also present differently, but often feel amplified. Borders like race and class aren’t as visible, especially when you’re communicating via 
text rather than in person. On the other hand, it takes time and often money to become invested in more active communities, which often unintentionally makes these spaces inaccessible. Access to things like high-speed internet and higher quality 
technology also creates a border that’s intricately tied to things like class and location. These are only a few examples, but there are countless others. What’s interesting is that, the more I think about it, the more I realize that all of these borders 
are in no way new or exclusive to the internet- it’s just that the internet forces you to confront them. Time zones don’t always seem like an impactful border in person, but the internet makes them personally and directly impactful.

	<p>To understand the scope of these borders, it’s important to look to the history of online communities and the social applications of the internet. In many ways, the history of online communities is just the history of the internet. Turkle considers “the computer as a 
catalyst of culture formation”, which we see very evidently in the variety of uses of computers throughout history. From its very conception, people have been using the internet socially. Prototype “versions” of the internet have existed since the 60’s. Although established 
and accessible chat platforms didn’t start to surface until the 70’s, it was possible to send messages from user to user within the same mainframe in the mid-60s via what would eventually become email. Additionally, as soon as home computers became popular, in-person computer 
clubs started to spring up, connecting people interested in computers to their local communities.
<br><br>
Even early on in the era of computer clubs, there was a distinction between kinds of users: people were generally either hobbyists, casually interested in computers and their uses, or hackers, interested in learning how computers worked and how far their technology could go. This is one 
of the earliest clear examples of a border in computer-based communities (and this was before these communities were even primarily online- these were just within groups of computer enthusiasts). The other border, which remains an issue up through the present day, is the question of access. 
Early computers required expensive or difficult parts and components, and also required users to have a decent degree of computer knowledge. However, most of this knowledge was self-taught, making it decently accessible to people with the time and energy to devote to learning it. This issue has adapted, but hasn’t gone away- more on that later.
<br><br>
The history of online socialization is extensive and would be impossible to document in its entirety, but here’s a brief timeline of some important milestones:	
</p>

		<ul class="timeline">
	<li>70’s: Rise of asynchronous communication (newsgroups and message boards), early multiplayer gaming</li>
	<li>80’s: Synchronous communication (Internet Relay Chat)</li>
	<li>90’s: Web page formatting, community forums, game accessibility (“low-impact” and reduced bandwidth modes), mp3 file formatting (easier sharing of music), first instances of sites (ex: eBay) using a “rating system” becomes the origin of “internet reputation”</li>
	<li>Early 2000’s: Adobe flash and flash games, Wikipedia (large-scale community moderation), early social media (MySpace and Facebook), voice and video chat (Skype and TeamSpeak)</li>
	<li>Late 2000’s: Increased commercialization, current social media (Youtube and Twitter), HTML reformatting for mobile devices</li>
	<li>2010’s: Monopolization of the internet, newest social media targeted at younger users (Instagram, Snapchat)</li>
		</ul>
<p>As online communication becomes more and more popularized, it becomes more accessible to the general public, but also less understandable. Some smaller computer-centric subcultures put emphasis on understanding the programs they use, such as the open source movement, but the general public has little incentive to 
learn how the software they use works. It’s incredibly complicated and will serve all of its purposes without any computer science knowledge. The internet of the 21st century has also seen the increased commercialization of online space; popular sites are increasingly used for marketing and advertising, and have also become major 
sources of profit to the massive corporations that own them. I would argue that these two phenomena are linked; corporations don’t actually want you to understand their platforms, because it makes their users more aware of the ways in which these programs are designed to steal your data and your attention. Online communities are more common than ever, 
but they’re also incredibly reliant on the resources of these massive corporations that provide spaces for them rather than the open-source commons of the earlier internet.</p>

  <h4 class="tab" id="community">Online Communities <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS-toj8khIlGztizZRqa4NWHGIi5dDXKWnhEd1sbvBfOWr7bvpGslmNH-EhXDfWKhLCvng&usqp=CAU" class="chat"/></h4>
<p>This is something I’ve observed within my own online communities. Most of my interactions with internet friends are mediated through a platform called Discord. Discord is a server-based text/voice/video chat platform that’s existed since 2015 but has been embraced by online communities of all sorts more recently. The appeal of Discord is its customizability; 
a server is owned by one person (and often also led by a group of selected moderators) who can create and organize different discussion channels, create custom server “emotes” (little emojis that are exclusive to that server), and organize users via custom role systems. There’s also an incredibly active Discord bot community- people have created software that adds 
a wide variety of custom features, ranging from the ability to play music for people in a voice call to assisting with moderation to adding games for users to play. Because of its customizability, Discord is used by a wide range of different communities. I’m personally in servers that have 5 members and in servers that have over 30,000 people. Currently Discord is fairly unique, 
which means these communities have become very heavily reliant on it because there isn’t a convenient alternative. When using the platform to engage in a community, I’m always acutely aware that the community couldn’t exist in the same way without the platform. Discord also has a reputation for being not particularly secure with user data. According to their most recent data transparency reports, 
they received 3,662 total pieces of legal process between July and December 2020 (and complied to the vast majority), meaning they supplied user data for legal processes. Although not illegal, it’s still deeply unsettling to know that all of the data from your conversations is being recorded and could potentially be used against you. Discord users are vaguely aware that these communities that mean 
so much to them aren’t actually their own and are moderated entirely by an external company, but the modern day internet provides few other alternatives.
<br><br>
Additionally, community platforms are increasingly being used for profit via advertising and user payments. A strong example of this is Twitch, which is a live-streaming platform. There are a few other semi-popular streaming platforms, but Twitch is generally the largest. One of the appeals of Twitch as a platform is their affiliate program; once live streamers reach a few relatively easy milestones, 
they become eligible to gain paid subscribers. A subscription costs about $5 a month and has a few benefits, like fewer ads on that channel and access to some custom chat emojis, but it’s generally just considered an easy way to support a content creator who you enjoy. However, Twitch is owned by Amazon, and gets 50% of the profit from every subscription. Both Twitch and individual affiliate streamers 
do whatever they can to incentivize subscribing, because it makes them some money. However, it creates a situation in which you can’t support this content creator without also supporting Amazon. This specific scenario is fairly unique to Twitch, but the issue of social media platforms exploiting their user base for profit isn’t. Some platforms encourage payment to creators while also taking a cut of the payment, 
while others algorithmically design their platform to keep users as active as possible, like Instagram and Youtube. This, once again, creates a situation in which online communities and people's social lives rely heavily on the space that corporations have made for them. The knowledge that these communities are only being supported while they’re actively creating profit for the companies that run them raises serious concerns 
about the sustainability and longevity of this system; once people get tired of having their money and data taken by these companies, they have nowhere else to turn.</p>

  <h4 class="tab" id="conclusion">Conclusion <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/561/561104.png" class="button"/></h4>
<p>All of this culminates into a situation in which it’s very hard to create something online that’s truly yours. You and your friends can have your group chat or your Discord server, you can have your twitter page or instagram account, but it’s not yours- it’s ultimately still property of the company that owns the service. The monopolization of the internet actively profits off of communities building themselves within their 
systems and services. This also raises more existential questions about our online personas: if this version of me only exists through a corporate platform, is it truly me? Has this giant company become entangled in my concept of self?
<br><br>
This brings me to my intervention- this site. It’s in no way completely borderless- for starters, I don’t have the resources required to host a site entirely on my own. It’s being hosted by GithubPages and is ultimately “theirs”, but it’s not restricted by many of the kinds of borders that websites are often entangled in. There’s no exchange of money, no advertising, no corporate control here- I wrote all of it. All of this text
 and image is hosted by some lines of HTML that I wrote specifically for the purpose of having a place for these thoughts outside the borders of traditional website hosting services. GitHub projects are also open-source,
 <a href="https://github.com/aaverymg/borderasmethod" target="_blank">so you can look through all of my code if you’d like.</a>
It’s also still subject to a host of other forms of borders (ideological, language, etc). It may not be completely borderless, but more of the borders at play 
are in my control. I can enforce them as much or as little as I choose to. And this is only the beginning- a truly modular, customizable, transparent, and open source Internet is possible. A future where we actually understand the platforms we use, the language that makes them work, the systems that are working together to bring you this experience. The virtual commons isn’t easily accessible under the current monopolized internet, but 
it’s not out of reach entirely. Borders are often out of our control as individuals, but we need to address the ones we can control. The internet will never be truly borderless as long as there are forms of borders between its users, but alleviating the borders imposed by corporate monopolies moves us towards a space in which the virtual commons is within reach. </p>
