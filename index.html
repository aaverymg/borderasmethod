     <strong>In a world where our lives are primarily or even entirely online, it becomes critical to examine the digital structures that are now facilitating our social lives.</strong>
     The internet has an extensive history both as a technology and as a platform for communication. It creates a space that supports a variety of subcultures and communities. 
      Internet history is largely unexplored and undocumented, especially regarding its social usage. Looking at these communities at a micro level is definitely interesting and worthwhile, 
      but in today’s circumstances it becomes more urgent to look at the phenomenon of online communities at a macro level. The problems of our real and in-person lives appear differently through online mediums, 
      and it’s critical to examine the ways in which the regular borders of our lives are impacted by method and platform. First, I explore the phenomenon of the “virtual self”, or the personas that people adopt online. 
      Then, I cover a brief history of the social applications of the internet, as well as my own experiences with online communities. 
      Finally, I look to the phenomenon of borders, focusing on “real” borders that are recreated, as well as new and uniquely online borders that are presented.
